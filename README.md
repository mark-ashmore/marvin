# Marvin

Marvin is my personal assistant project, where I am experimenting with the basic
concepts of NLP, NLU, and NLG.

## Install notes

Install the requirements.txt packages.

If you are running a newer version of python you may get an install error for
the `playsound` package. Try running the following instead:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/killjoy1221/playsound.git
```

This will install the package directly from github.
